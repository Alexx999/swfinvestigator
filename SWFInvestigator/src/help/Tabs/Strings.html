    <H3>Strings Viewer</H3>
	<P>This functionality currently only works for AS3 content due to the backend library that I am using.  It is the list of
	strings extracted from the SWF.  You can search the strings list for interesting terms using the search functionality at the
	top left of the tab. The number of identified strings is also displayed in the top left.</P>
	<P><B>Security relevant strings</B><br>
    The list in the bottom left of the tab displays a subset of the overall strings list. In this section, you will see strings
    that suggest the use of security relevant APIs. The default list of terms is maintained in /configs/SecurityStrings.txt and
    can be modified by the user. The user can also choose to load their own list at run time by using the <I>Choose</I> button
    located at the bottom of the list. The comparison is a strict match based on the terms provided. Therefore, if one of the
    security terms provided is "frame" and the SWF contains a string named "frame1", then it won't be identified as a match.
    </P>
