    <P>The Tag Viewer allows you to view tag information and raw SWF bytes of each tag in the file.</P>
    <B>Tags</B><br/>
    <P>The tags are listed in order from first to last in the left hand column of the tab. Clicking on a tag will display
    the information in the Tag Information column.<br/>
    If the tag has a red "E" as its icon, then it means there was an error attempting to parse that tag. See the tag for
    additional information. 
    </P>
    <br/>
    <B>Tag Information</B><br/>
    <P>For each tag, you will be able to see the basic tag properties along with the hex bytes for that tag. For some supported
    tags, the pane will display an XML summary of the tag in the same format as the Flex SDK swfdump tool. 
    </P>
    <br/>
    <B>To Do:</B><br/>
    <P>While most tags are supported, there may be a few without support. This will be improved over time.
