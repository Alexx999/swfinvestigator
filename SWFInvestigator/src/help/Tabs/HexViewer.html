    <H3>Hex Viewer</H3>
    <P>The Hex Viewer allows you to view and edit the raw SWF bytes in the original format or as a decompressed SWF if the file was originally saved as a compressed SWF.
    The Hex Viewer can be a little slow with larger files so please be patient.</P>
    <P><B>Viewing the Hex</B><br>
    If the original SWF was compressed, then you can view the SWF either in its original form or as a decompressed SWF.  Decompression is done using the builtin ActionScript decompress API.
    If the SWF was originally decompressed, then you can only view it in it's original decompressed form.<br>
    <B>Note:</B> Choosing to view the Original SWF after you have made changes to a decompressed SWF will result in any changes being lost.</P>
    <P><B>Editing the Hex</B><br>
    You can edit the Hex inline.  Editing the hex in columns 0 - 15 will automatically update the string column.
    </P>
    <P><B>Saving the Changes</B><br>
    If the file was originally compressed, you will have the option to save the file either re-compressed using the ActionScript compress API or in the new decompressed format.
    If the original file was not in a compressed format, then you will only have the option to save the file as a decompressed file.
    </P>
    <P><B>Copying and deleting data from the grid</B><br>
    You can select multiple cells from the data grid and use Ctrl-C to copy the data to the system clipboard. The hex digits will be copied to the clipboard as comma separated string data e.g. de,ad,be,ef
    To select a range of cells, you do not need to highlight each individual cell. You can just highlight the first and last cell to be copied.
    Using Ctrl-X and Ctrl-V work similarly. In order to paste, the source data must also be in the same string format as copying from the data grid.
    If you use Ctrl-A to select all, only the binary data will be copied to the clipboard. The "offset","string" and space columns will not be copied.
    You can also paste the data into the Binary Editor <i>Source data</i> text field for copying the hex into the Binary Editor data grid.
