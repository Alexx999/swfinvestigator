    <H3>SWF Viewer</H3>
	<P>The basic idea is that it allows you to load a SWF using different HTML configurations in a browser pane.
	For instance, you can load a SWF from your local hard drive and have the browser pretend it was loaded from the specified domain,
	with the specified FlashVars and the specified allowScriptAccess settings. If you need the SWF to have specific HTML,
    then you can change the default HTML template the SWF. To prevent accidental execution of the SWF, you will not see anything in
    the browser pane until you click "Load".</P><BR/>
	<B>URL: </B> <P>The URL of the SWF to be loaded. This can be changed to any URL but it will be prepopulated with the current SWF.</P>
	<B>allowScriptAccess/allowNetworking: </B><P>These will alter whether the parameters in the object tag for the SWF.  By default they are
	disabled to prevent accidentally allowing the SWF to execute JavaScript.</P>
	<B>Send Cookies: </B><P>Tells the AIR HTMLLoader whether to track system cookies between requests using the "manageCookies" property</P>
	<B>FlashVars: </B><P>Enter the FlashVars for the SWF and they will be added to the FlashVars parameter in the object tag.</P>
	<B>HTML Domain: </B><P>If you want to remap the HTML to a different domain, then enter in the domain in this field.</P>
	<B>HTML Template: </B><P>The name of the template file in app-storage:/Viewer to use to load the SWF. Do <i>not</i> make changes to the
	default template as they will be overwritten the next time the app starts.</P>
	<B>Reload Button: </B><P>Reloads the HTML with the entered data.</P>
	<B>Open Introspector</B><BR/>
	<P>This will open the AIR Introspector.  This was originally added to help catch changes to the HTML by ExternalInterface.  However,
	it currently doesn't seem to be as useful for that.  It is left here because it may be useful for something else in the future.</P>
