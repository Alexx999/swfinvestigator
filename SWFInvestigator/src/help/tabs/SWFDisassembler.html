    <H3>SWF Disassembler</H3>
	<P>This will produce slightly different styles of output for AVM1 and AVM2 due to the back end library that
	is being used (abcdump for AS3 and swfdump for AS2). The search box at the top will allow you to find key words
	within the source dump.  For larger SWFs, the disassesmbly will be broken into pages to speed rendering.
	The incrementor at the bottom of the disassembly view allows you to increment pages. Although, it is a little
	counter-intuitive in that you currently click the up in order to scroll down. You can choose to view
	the disassembly in your default '.txt' editor by clicking <I>'Open with Text Viewer'</I> at the bottom of the
	page</P>
	<P> Next to constants, you may see "//nameIndex=XX". This is added by the disassembler just to be able
	cross-reference the string constant with the constant pool.</P>
	<P>At the top of the page, you can choose to use a different decompiler or disassembler rather than the
	internal version. This feature is only available if you installed SWF Investigator using a native installer.
	If you installed SWF Investigator using a '.air' file, then this feature is not available.
	You specify the location of the decompiler and the default arguments in your Preferences settings. The
	arguments that will be used show up in the text field. You can modify the arguments if necessary within the
	text field. Once you click update, the executable will be called and the output will show up in the display
	pane.</P>
	<B>Note For Mac Users</B><BR/>
	<P>If you try to set up the Flex SDK version of swfdump in your decompiler list, then ensure that you have it
	in a path without spaces. Please see the <a href="../general/preferences.html">preferences</a> page for more
	information.</P>
