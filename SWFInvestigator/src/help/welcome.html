    <H3>Adobe SWF Investigator Beta</H3>
    <P>Adobe SWF Investigator is designed to be an open-source application that provides developers,
    QEs, and security researchers with the ability to have insight into their SWF applications. The SWF Investigator
    tabs display static information regarding the SWF file. The Inspector tab will allow you to dynamically interact
    with the SWF as it is running. Users have the capability to view the LSO data stored on their machines. In addition,
    SWF Investigator enables testing the SWF Application and its services for potential security vulnerabilities.</P>
    <B>Getting Started</B>
    <P>You can use the various utilities available from the pull down menus at any time.
    In order to examine a SWF, go to File and select either <I>Open URL</I> to load a SWF from the web or <I>Open File</I>
    to open a local file.  This will load the SWF and initialize the different tabs. Alternatively, you can drag a SWF file
    into any of the main tabs to load a SWF.  Currently, you can only have one SWF open at a time.</P>
    <B>Getting the source</B>
    <P>The home page for this application is currently located on <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/swfinvestigator/">Adobe Labs</a>.
    The source code for this application can be found on the Open@Adobe <a href="http://sourceforge.net/adobe/swfinvestigator/wiki/Home/">SWF Investigator</a>
    page. The source is released under the MPL 1.1 license.
    </P>
    <B>Background</B>
    <P>This tool was originally developed with the assumption that the target SWF is considered untrusted.  Therefore,
    it avoids having to cache the SWF on the disk and never import loads the SWF. If you are looking at a remote SWF in
    the Viewer or Inspector, it is as loaded using the security context of its original URL.</P>
