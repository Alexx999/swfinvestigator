    <H3>AMF Fuzzer</H3>
    <P>The AMF Fuzzer is based on the AMF Transmitter and it allows you to query remote AMF Services and retrieve the result.  This feature is still experimental until a way is determined to
    dynamically set Remote alias information for an object.
    </P>
    <P>The basic premise of the tool is that you specify the AMF URI, the destination name and the function you wish to call in the first three fields.  Then you
    add any parameters that should be sent. You can set any creds that need to be sent with the connection. These should all be the baseline values for a normal
    request.  Then, select which fields you want to fuzz by setting the "fuzz" field to "y". You can specify custom fuzz parameters using a <a href="fuzz.html">fuzz.xml</A></P>
    <B>RO Endpoint:</B><P>The URL of the AMF Gateway that has the function you are calling.</P>
    <B>RO Destination:</B><P>The destination name that is to supplied to the RO Endpoint.</P>
    <B>RO Function:</B><P>The name of the remote function that you will call.</P>
    <B>Function Parameters/New Value:</B><P>This is where you add the parameters that will be sent across the AMF connection. This is similar to the functionality in
    the <a href="../tabs/Inspector.html">AS3 Inspectors</a>.  For information on how to add Classes and Objects, please click
    <a href="../general/ObjectEntry.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The text field at the top should include the class name that you would supply to a <i>registerClassAlias</i> call in ActionScript</p>
    <B>Auth Information:</B><P>The username and password for the connection.  The <I>Remote Credentials</I> checkbox dictates whether the <I>RemoteObject.setCredentials</I>
    or the <I>RemoteObject.setRemoteCredentials</I> function is used to set authentication information on the connection.</P>
    <B>Submit Query:</B><P>The Submit Query button executes the call to the remote service.</P>
    <B>Output Tab:</B><P>This will contain the response from each query.</P>
    <B>Save Response:</B><P>This button allows you to save the response log.</P>
