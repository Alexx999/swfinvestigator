    <H3>Mini Web Server</H3>
    <P>
    The Mini Web Server is an extremely basic web server for returning HTML and SWF content. It does not support any of the
    advanced features of a real web server such as cookies, CGI support, etc. The server can return basic files with a
    Content-type and Content-length header. Supported file extensions include .html, .htm, .js, .xml, .swf, .png, .jpg, .gif,
    .css, .ico, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx and .pdf. The server will shut down if you close the window.  
    </P>
    <B>Choosing the directory</B><BR/>
    <P>The first thing you need to do is select the directory that will act as your root directory of the web server. All file
    fetches will be relative to this directory.</P>
    <B>Choosing the IP address and port</B><BR/>
    <P>The next step is to choose the IP address and port the server will listen on. Using the defaults is probably fine for
    most occasions. However, the XSS fuzzer also starts a web server so you may run into issues if you are trying to use both
    at the same time. If you do want to run both simultaneously, then just choose a different port for the Mini Web Server.</P>
    <B>Starting and stopping the server</B><BR/>
    <P>Use the <I>Start Listening</I> and <I>Stop Listening</I> buttons to start and stop the web server. If the server is
    already listening when you click the <I>Start Listening</I> button then it will shut down and start over.</P>
    <B>Saving Preferences</B><BR/>
    <P>The <I>Remember These Settings</I> button will all you to save the current configuration of to your preferences database.
    </P>
    <B>Status field</B><BR/>
    <P>The status field will display information on whether the server is listening and any errors that are encountered as it
    is running.</P>
