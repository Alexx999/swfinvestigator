    <H3>AMF Identifier</H3>
    <P>The AMF Identifier allows you to perform brute force identification of destination and methods using a dictionary file.
    </P>
    <P>The basic premise of the tool is that you specify the AMF URI of the service you want to enumerate.  If you are enumerating methods, then you must also provide
    the destination name.  Once all the options are selected, the AMF Identifier will start querying the service and inspecting error messages to determine if the
    destination or method exists on the server.</P>
    <B>RO Endpoint:</B><P>The URL of the AMF Gateway that has the function you are calling.</P>
    <B>RO Destination:</B><P>The destination name that is to supplied to the RO Endpoint.</P>
    <B>Brute Force:</B><P>Select whether you are trying to brute force destinations or methods.</P>
    <B>Auth Information:</B><P>The username and password for the connection.  The <I>Remote Credentials</I> checkbox dictates whether the <I>RemoteObject.setCredentials</I>
    or the <I>RemoteObject.setRemoteCredentials</I> function is used to set authentication information on the connection.</P>
    <B>Dictionary File:</B><P>This will create a pop-up where you can select the dictionary file.  It will only show files ending in <I>.txt</I> or <I>.dict</I>. Doubel click on
    the file you want to use in order to select. You can also manually enter the location of the file using the native path for the OS.  e.g. <I>C:\test.txt</I>  </P>
    <B>Query Interval:</B><P>The AMF Identifer will make a request every 330 milliseconds by default.  Adjust this value to adjust the number of queries per second.</P>
    <B>Start Queries:</B><P>The Start Queries button will begin attempting to enumerate services.</P>
    <B>Reset:</B><P>This will stop any running queries and reset everything back to the beginning.  You will need to click <I>Start Queries</I> to restart the scan.</P>
    <B>Output:</B><P>This will contain the response from the remote query.  Anytime a destination or service is found, it will be placed at the top of the Output box and
    start with the word <I>FOUND</I> followed by additional information. All failure information is tagged onto the end of the output as responses come back.</P>
