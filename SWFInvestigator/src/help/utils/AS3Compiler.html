   <H3>AS3 Compiler Tab</H3>
   <P>The AS3 Compiler is intended to compile small sections of ActionScript 3 code. This utility leverages code from the Mozilla
   Tamarin project. The compiled code can be written to a console on the left or to a full SWF in a new browser window. To method
   for printing output to the screen is different for each method.</P>
   <B>Writing to the console</B><BR/>
   <P>When you compile code to use the console window, the compiled code is imported loaded into the current security context.
   <I><U>This means that it will run with full application privileges!</U></I> Therefore, do not compile anything that you don't
   completely trust. You can print to the console by calling Printer.print().</P>
   <table width="100%">
    <tr width="100%">
     <td width="100%" border="0" padding="0" style="background:DDDDDD">
      <pre>
     //To compile in this window and print
     //to your right use the following code.
     namespace ns = "utils.AS3Compiler";
     use namespace ns;
	 <BR/>
     Printer.print("Hello");
       </pre>
      </td>
     </tr>
   </table><BR/>
   <B>Writing to a new SWF</B><BR/>
   <P>You can also create a SWF that can launch in the browser. This SWF will be created inside a temp directory and launched
   from the local filesystem. The code for a SWF that can run in the browser is slightly different since you have to prep the
   stage. Below is the code necessary to print to the screen in a standalone SWF.</P>
   <table width="100%">
    <tr width="100%">
     <td width="100%" border="0" padding="0" style="background:DDDDDD">
      <pre>
	//If you plan to run the SWF in the browser
	//then use the following code
	namespace fd = "flash.display";
	use namespace fd;
	namespace ft = "flash.text";
	use namespace ft;
	<BR/>
	class test extends Sprite {
	  function test() {
		var t:TextField = new TextField();
		t.text = "Hello";
		addChild(t);
	  }
	}
          </pre>

   <B>Compile Button</B><BR/>
   <P>The <I>Compile</I> button will compile the code and place it in the hex editor but it will not try to
   execute the code. This can be useful to make sure your new code compiles as you write.</P>
   
   <B>Run Button</B><BR/>
   <P>Click the <I>Run</I> button when you are creating ActionScript code that will run in the console to
   the right.</P>
   
   <B>Run in Browser</B><BR/>
   <P>This will place a SWF wrapper around your ActionScript code and launch it using your default web browser.
   The file is loaded from a temp directory in your local filesystem.</P>
   
   <B>Load AS Source File Button</B><BR/>
   <P>If you have some classes already written for the AS3 Compiler you can load those files into the compiler
   using the <I>Load AS Source File</I> button.</P>
   
   <B>Save Source File Button</B><BR/>
   <P>The <I>Save Source File</I> button will save your ActionScript to a local file so that you can reuse it again.</P>
   <BR/>
   <HR/>
   <H3>Disassembler Tab</H3>
   <P>The disassembler tab will translate the ActionScript from the <I>AS3 Compiler</I> tab into AS3 bytecodes.
   </P>
   <B>Dump Verbose Button</B><BR/>
   <P>The <I>Dump Verbose</I> button will show additional information regarding the compiled bytecode.</P>
   <BR>
   <HR/>
   <H3>Hex Editor</H3>
   <P>The hex editor shows the ActionScript in binary form as ActionScript bytecodes. It works the same as the Hex Editor
   tab and the Binary Editor utility with Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-A and Ctrl-X support. You are also able to drag a file into
   the hex viewer but it will not automatically disassemble.</P>
   
   <B>Load ABC File Button</B><BR/>
   <P>As the name implies, this will allow you to load a file from the hard drive into the hex editor.</P>
   
   <B>Wrap In SWF Button</B><BR/>
   <P>The <I>Wrap In SWF</I> button will wrap the ActionScript in SWF tags so it can be launched as an independent
   SWF.</P>
   
   <B>Update Disassembler Button</B><BR/>
   <P>If you modify the hex in the hex editor, you can have the disassembler tab reflect your changes. It will not do this
   automatically because you would get errors as you changed each byte. It will not update the source tab since it can not
   do decompilation. It can only do disassembly.</P>
   
   <B>Save Button</B><BR/>
   <P>The <I>Save</I> button will save the information from the hex editor to a local file of your choosing.</P>
