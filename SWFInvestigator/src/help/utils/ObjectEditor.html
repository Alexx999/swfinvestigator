   <H3>Object Editor</H3>
   <P>The Object Editor allows you edit ActionScript objects using definitions in memory, from dynamically loaded SWFs, saved
   AMF files or by custom crafting them.</P>

   <B>Class Info</B><BR/>
   <P>This will contain a text representation of the object that is created from the class. The <i>Register Class Name</i> and
   <i>Save To File</i> button will allow you to create a local AMF file for the object. By checking <i>Register Class Name</i>,
   the ObjectEditor will try to register the class name in the <i>Fetch Class</i> section with the object before saving so that
   it isn't lost when the object is converted to AMF.</P>

   <B>Read File</B><BR/>
   <P>Click this button if you have already have an AMF file with the object defined that you can load from the filesystem.
   This is an alternative to the <i>Fetch Class</i> approach.</P>

   <B>Fetch Class</B><BR/>
   <P>If you want to create an object dynamically, then type in the Fully Qualified Name of the class (eg. mx.controls.TextArea).
   Next you will tell the object editor where to find the class. Your options are:</P>
   <ul>
     <li><i>System</i> - A builtin object or one the Object Editor already knows about.</li>
     <li><i>Remote</i> - Import load (via Loader.loadBytes) a SWF that has the class.</li>
     <li><i>Local</i> - Import load a SWF from the file system that has the class.</li>
   </ul>
   <P>You may see an error when loading the SWF but you can probably ignore it.
   Click <i>Get class definition</i> to fetch the class.
   </P>
   <B>Variable to Assign</B><BR/>
   <P>This is the same variable interface that is used throughout SWF Investigator.</P>
   <B>Debug Output</B><BR/>
   <P>This is just left over from debugging the implementation. Debug information can be found in this display.</P>
