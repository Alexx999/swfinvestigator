    <P>The Settings Viewer allows you to view the Flash Player settings.sol files. To use the Settings Viewer
    click the <I>Choose Settings File</I> button. This will open a file chooser which points to the Flash Player
    settings storage directory. You will see folders for each domain which you visited that has Flash content. Not
    all of these folders will have settings files. The easiest way to determine which directories have settings files,
    open the settings.sol file in the root directory. This is Flash Player's primary settings file with your default
    settings. Once you open that file, the text field will be populated with everything contained within that settings
    file. The primary settings.sol file maintains a list of the domains for which it created per-domain settings.sol
    files.
    </P>
