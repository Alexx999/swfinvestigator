    <H3>LC Communicator</H3>
    <P> The Local Connection Communicator allows you to dynamically send or receive
    data to and from Local Connections on any given domain.To begin using the LC
    Communicator, enter the domain you will be sending your local connections from
    and click <I>Re-Map</I>.  Then choose to either the <I>LC Sender</I> or
    <I>LC Receiver</I> tab to begin sending or receiving data.
    </P><BR/>
    
    <B>LC Sender</B>
    <P>Once you have remapped the LC Communicator to the domain you will be sending
    from, you need to provide information on the connection that you will be sending
    data to.  The first field is the connection name.  If you are sending data to a
    local connection that is on the same domain and as the LC Communicator, then you
    do not need to prefix the connection name with the target domain.  If you will be
    sending data to a different domain, then you need to prefix the connection name
    with the target domain in the same format as you would in ActionScript
    (<I>domain:connectionName</I> or just <I>connectionName</I>). Once you have
    entered the name of the connection, you then enter the target function.<BR/>
    You can then add variables to the data grid representing the data you plan to send.
    Just like with the <a href="../tabs/Inspector.html">AS3 Inspector</a> utility,
    you enter the value of the variable in the text box below the data grid and select
    the type of the variable.  Then click <I>Add Parameter</I> to add the variable to
    the list of items that will be sent.  Once you have added all the items, you can
    click <I>Send</I> to send the data.<BR/><BR/>
    
    <B>Note:</B> The utility works better if the receiving connection is already set
    up before you click send.<BR/>
    </P><BR/>
    
    <B>LC Receiver</B>
    <P>
    To receive connections, select the <I>LC Receiver</I> tab. Enter the connection
    name in the same format as described for the <I>LC Sender</I> tab.  You then can
    specify the receiving function name. You can also specify the <i>allowDomain</i>
    setting. However, this may be unnecessary if you have already re-mapped the LC
    Communicator to the target domain.  Click <I>Add Function</I> to start the
    listener.  You are now ready to start receiving Local Connections for that function.
    To stop receiving connections, close the <I>LC Communicator</I>.
    </P>
    
    <B>LC Fuzzer</B>
    <P>The LC Fuzzer started as a thought experiment. As a fuzzer, you are unlikely to
    find much in a target SWF. However, the LC fuzzer allows you to send multiple
    sequential messages across a Local Connection which is more useful for testing.
    It will be re-built specifically for this purpose at a later date.<BR/>
    You set up the connection the same that you set up a connection for the <I> LC
    Receiver</I>. However, on this tab you have the option of choosing which of the
    fields you want fuzzed. The output from the fuzzing effort will be show in the
    <I>Fuzzer Output</I> tab. You can provide also provide a custom
    <a href="fuzz.html">fuzz.xml</a> file.</P>
    
    <B>Fuzzer Output</B>
    <P>This tab is used to display the output of an <I>LC Fuzzer</I> run. The left
    had pane will allow you to navigate through the results. The right hand pane will
    show whether the Local Connection was successfully received or not. Local
    Connection's do not return much in the way of status to the sender, therefore the
    output pane can only show you whether the message was successfully received or not.</P>
