    <H3>Binary Editor</H3>
    <P>The Binary Editor allows you to do two things. It allows you to open a local file and edit it. It also allows
    you to convert a string of integers into a hex representation of bytes.
	</P>
	
	<B>Source Data</B><BR>
	<P>In this text field you can put a string of integers to convert. It will accept two basic formats. The first is a
	string of Integers in the format <I>"12345678, 87654321"</I>. Do not include the parenthesis. If you use this format,
	then you would click the <I>Convert Integers to Hex</I> button.</P>
	<P>The second format allowed is a hex format. The hex characters can be entered several ways including
	<I>"0x44445555", "44555544", "44,55" or "0x44,0x55"</I>. Do not include the parenthesis. If you use this format, then
	you would click the <I>Copy Hex To Grid</I> button.</P>
	
	<B>Load a File</B><BR/>
	<P>The <I>Load a file</I> button will open a file chooser that will allow you to select a file for editing.
	Alternatively, you can also drag a file from the file system into the hex editor.</P> 
	
	<B>Find functionality</B><BR/>
	<P>You can enter text into the text field above the right hand corner of the hex grid, choose whether to search
	for a string or hex from the pull down menu and then click <I>Find</I> to find data within the hex grid.</P>
	
	<B>Compress</B><BR/>
	<P>This button allows you to compress the current byte array using the AS compress function.</P>
	
	<B>Uncompress</B><BR/>
	<P>This button allows you to uncompress the current byte array using the AS uncompress function.</P>
	
	<B>XOR</B><BR/>
	<P>You can XOR all the bytes in the array by providing an integer in the text field and clicking XOR. The text box
	supports traditional integers as well as hex values in a "0xAA" format.</P>
	
	<B>Save</B><BR/>
	<P>Once you are done editing within the hex grid, you can click <I>Save</I> to save the file to the filesystem</P>
	
	<B>Copying and deleting data from the grid</B><BR/>
    <P>You can select multiple cells from the data grid and use Ctrl-C to copy the data to the system clipboard.
    To select a range of cells, you do not need to highlight each individual cell. You can just highlight the first and
    last cell to be copied. The hex digits will be copied to the clipboard as comma separated string data
    e.g. de,ad,be,ef  The commands Ctrl-X and Ctrl-V work in a similar fashion. In order for a paste to work, the data
    must be in the same string format as used with Ctrl-C. If you use Ctrl-A to select all, only the binary data will
    be copied to the clipboard. The "offset","string" and space columns will not be copied. 
    </P>
