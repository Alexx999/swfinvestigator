    <H3>Cross-Domain Tester</H3>
    <P>The cross-domain tester allows you to test whether your cross-domain policy file will allow loading from a specific
    domain. Enter the domain that you want to attempt to load data from in the text box at the top of the page and click
    <I>Re-Map</I>. This will load the Cross-Domain Tester in the security context of that domain. Then, provide the relevant
    information for the load operation in the fields below and click <I>Submit Request</I> to determine if the cross-domain
    policy on the target site will allow the data to load.
    </P>
    <B>Important Note</B><BR/>
    <P>
    Cross-domain policy files are cached by Flash Player. If you want to test a new version of the cross-domain policy file,
    then click <I>Re-Map</I> at the top of the window to reload the SWF and clear the cache.
    </P>
    <B>URL</B><BR/>
    <P>
    This is the URL for the data that you want to load. It should be the site that hosts the cross-domain policy file.
    </P>
    <B>METHOD</B><BR/>
    <P>
    This is the HTTP request method for this request ("GET","POST", etc.).
    </P>
    <B>POST BODY</B><BR/>
    <P>
    If this request is a POST, then you would provide the data that you would send with the post request.
    </P>
    <B>HTTP Header Checkbox</B><BR/>
    <P>
    If this request will send custom HTTP headers, then enable this check box. Custom HTTP headers typically have to be
    allowed by the cross-domain policy file.
    </P>
    <B>HTTP Header</B><BR/>
    <P>
    Within these two text boxes, you would provide the header information. The first text box is the header name. The
    second text box is the header value.
    </P>
    <B>Policy File</B><BR/>
    <P>
    If you need to load a cross-domain policy file from a sub-directory, then use this text box to provide the URL of the
    child cross-domain policy file. Policy files in sub-directories must be supported within the master cross-domain policy
    file.
    </P>
    <B>Submit Request</B><BR/>
    <P>
    Once all of the information is filled out for this cross-domain request, pressing this button will submit the request to
    the remote server. The response will display in the <I>Output</I> text box to the right.
    </P>
    <B>Output</B><BR/>
    <P>
    The result from the cross-domain request will display in this text box. You can also confirm that the domain that you have
    chosen at the top of the page has taken effect. When the SWF first loads, it will display its current domain security
    context within this text field.
    </P>
