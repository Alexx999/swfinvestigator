    <H3>LSO Editor</H3>
	<P>The LSO Editor allows you to inspect LSO's on the local hard drive.  If a
	SWF is currently loaded into SWF Investigator and it is not a local SWF,
	then the LSO Editor should automatically pick the correct directory for you. 
	The type of object is determined by using the ActionScript typeof()
	function which limits a more precise analysis of the individual pieces of data.</P>
	
	<P>If there is an Object stored within the LSO, the name of the variable and its
	type will be shown. The members of the object will be displayed in the following
	lines and will be indented with a preceding "*".  If the LSO contains an object
	that contains another object, then its children will be
	indented by a preceding "**" and so on for each recursively nested object.</P>
	
	<B>Updating Data</B><BR/>
	<P>You can change the data by entering the name of the variable in the <I>Name</I>
	field.  If you are changing a property of an object, then enter the name
	using a dotted notation (ex. foo.bar).  Then enter the new value within the
	<I>Value</I> field and select the type of variable the data should be cast as
	for the LSO.  Click	<I>Update</I> and the variable should be updated and the page
	should reload with the new information.</P>
	
	<B>Important Notes</B><BR/>
	<P>This currently doesn't work for localhost or localWithNet LSOs.<BR/>
	The LSO Editor cannot open Shared objects if "Allow third party content to store data
	on your computer" is not set within the Flash settings manager.<BR/>
	If you encounter Error 2134 and you allow third-party cookies, then just try selecting
	the .sol file again. Occasionally, it has trouble on the first load.
	This may also be caused if the LSO is in use.<BR/>
	</P>
