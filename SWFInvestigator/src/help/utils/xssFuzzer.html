    <H3>XSS Fuzzer</H3>
    <P>
    The XSS Fuzzer will allow you to test files on your local hard drive for common cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. You
    must know the FlashVars that the SWF accepts in order to use this feature. You can only test one file at a time.
    </P>
    <B>Target SWF</B><BR/>
    <P>
    Use the "Load SWF" button to select the file that you want to test.
    </P>
    <B>Flash Vars</B><BR/>
    <P>
    Specify the FlashVars that this SWF accepts. Use the traditional FlashVar format of "foo=1&bar=2".
    </P>
    <B>Attack Strings File</B><BR/>
    <P>
    This is the database of strings that will be passed to each FlashVar. The default file in configs/xssStrings.txt contains
    the most common strings. Use the "Load Strings" button to select a different file.
    </P>
    <B>Attack Definitions File</B><BR/>
    <P>
    This is an XML file that corresponds to the Attack Strings File. The default file is configs/xssDescriptions.xml. When an
    XSS issue is found, the fuzzer will check this XML document to determine whether there is a matching description of the
    attack and solution. These definitions will show up in the Output tab when the user clicks on one of the successful
    attack strings.
    </P>
    <B>Timeout for each test</B><BR/>
    <P>
    This fuzzer uses a series of events and timers. Therefore, each test takes approximately 5 seconds. If you change the default
    strings to load SWFs from another server, then you may want to allow more time for each test. You shouldn't use a time value
    below 3 seconds (3000) since the iframe contains a timer that doesn't fire until after 2 seconds.
    </P>
    <B>Set allowScriptAccess to Always</B><BR/>
    <P>
    The default allowScriptAccess setting for SWF content is "sameDomain". This is the setting that is enforced when an attacker
    tricks a user into clicking on a malicious link that goes directly to a URL. However, if your content uses an allowScriptAccess
    value of "always", then you may want to test your content with that setting. It can make a difference in the results. 
    </P>
    <B>Start Fuzzing</B><BR/>
    <P>
    Click this button to begin the test. The first test will begin after the time specified by the Timeout value. When the test
    completes, the window will automatically switch you to the results panel.
    </P>
    <B>Output Panel</B><BR/>
    <P>
    On the left hand side of the Output Panel, there is a tree navigation display with the name of each FlashVar. Ignore the entry
    for "baseline" since this particular tool does not run a baseline test. If you expand each FlashVar name, you will see the tests
    that were conducted. If the icon next to the attack string is red, then that means the attack was successful. If the icon next
    to the attackString is green, then the SWF is safe from that attack.
    </P>
    <B>Results</B><BR/>
    <P>After clicking on in individual item within the navigation tree of the output panel, you will see result information under
    <I>Results</I> on the right hand side. If the attack was unsuccessful, then it will just say, "No XSS Identified". If the attack
    was successful, then XSS Fuzzer will check the XSS Descriptions file to determine whether it has a verbose description of the
    attack and the solution. If it cannot find a corresponding entry in the descriptions file, then it will just say, "XSS Identified!".
    </P>
