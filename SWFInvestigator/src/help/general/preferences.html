    <B>General Tab</B><BR/>
    <I>Default file history length:</I><P>This is how many previous files the application will track in the File pull down
    menu.</P>
    <I>Sandbox Remap Port:</I><P>Many of the tricks performed by SWF Investigator leverage the fact that WebKit acknowledges port
    numbers in separating content and Flash Player does not.  This is the default port that SWF Investigator will use
    assuming that it is not being used by the site you are interacting with or a local service.  If it does conflict, then change
    the default port.</P>
    <I>Default View Template:</I><P>This is the file within app-storage:/Viewer/ that the SWF viewer will use to load the SWF.
    If you want to use a different HTML template to load the SWF in the SWF Viewer, then you would specify it here and copy it
    into the Viewer directory.  Be sure to copy the JS parsing for the FlashVars into the new template file.  Do <i>not</i> make
    changes to the default template because they will be overwritten the next time the app starts.</P>
    <I>HTTP User Agent:</I><P>This is the User Agent that will be sent to the web server when SWF Investigator makes web requests.</P>
    <I>Check for updates at launch:</I><P>Uncheck this box if you don't want SWF Investigator to check for updates at start up.</P>
    <B>Decompilers Tab</B><BR/>
    <P>This tab allows you to save the location and default arguments for decompilers to use in the Dissassembler Tab.</P>
    <I>Decompiler Name:</I><P>The list of the currently available decompilers. Clicking on a name will populate the text fields.</P>
    <I>Name:</I><P>The name you want to give the decompiler entry.</P>
    <I>Location:</I><P>The path to the executable that will be run. Mac users should be aware that this tool has a problem with
    directory paths that contain spaces. For instance, if you try to use the default path of
    "/Applications/Adobe Flash Builder 4.5/sdks/4.6.0/bin/swfdump" for the Flex swfdump utility then the AIR Native Process will
    have trouble launching it. Place a copy of the SDK in a path without spaces. If you try to move just the swfdump file itself
    to a new directory then it will fail to resolve the location of the associated jar files because they are linked using the
    relative path of "../lib/". You need to move the entire SDK or at least both the bin and lib directories.
    </P>
    <I>Arguments:</I><P>The default arguments that you want to pass to the executable. For instance, use "-abc" for the Flex swfdump
    utility. The file location of the SWF will be automatically appended to the end of the argument string so place any file arguments
    last.</P>
    <I>Add/Update:</I><P>Clicking this will save or update the information in the database.</P>
    <I>Delete:</I><P>Delete the the entry from the database. You cannot delete the internal disassessmbler.</P>
    <B>Domains Tab</B><BR/>
    <I>Default LCEnumerator Domain:</I><P>The default domain that LC Enumerator will use when loading a SWF.</P>
    <I>Default Web Server IP:</I><P>The default IP address the Mini Web Server will listen on.</P>
    <I>Default Web Server Port:</I><P>The default port that the Mini Web Server will listen on.</P>
    <I>Web Server Document Root:</I><P>The default document root for the web server.</P>
    <I>Default Fuzzing Domain:</I><P>This is the default domain name that SWFs will be remapped to when they are being fuzzed by the XSS Fuzzer.</P>
    <B>Configs Tab</B><BR/>
    <I>Default XSS Strings Config:</I><P>This is the plain text file containing all the attack strings that the XSS Fuzzer will use.</P>
    <I>Default XSS Descriptions XML:</I><P>This XML file corresponds with the XSS Strings config. It provides the description and solution for each
    attack string.</P>
    <I>Default Security Strings File:</I><P>This is a plain text file containing the security strings that the Strings tab should look for in the
    Strings list ofthe SWF.</P>
    <I>Default AMF Dictionary File:</I><P>This is a plain text file containing the list of names that the AMF Identifier will use when looking for
    services.</P>
