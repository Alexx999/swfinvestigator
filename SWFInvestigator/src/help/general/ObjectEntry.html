    <b>Entering Object Data</b><br/>
    <p>If you want to send an object to the SWF via a parameter entry field, it is not necessary to enter in any value.
    Just select <I>Object</I> from the pull down menu and a new panel will appear.</p>
    <img src="../assets/generalImages/ObjectEntry.jpg" height="300"><br/>
    <p>Within the new panel, you can enter in the name and value for each property of the object and select its data type.  If you would like to delete a property, then just
    delete the value in the name column for the entry that you want to delete.  Once de-selected, the row will be emptied.  Click <I>Create</I> once the object is defined.</p>
    <b>Entering Class Data</b><br/>
    <p>There is a similar panel for creating an object and registering the class via RegisterClassAlias. Just select
    <i>class</i> from the pull down menu if it is available. The following window will appear:</p>
    <img src="../assets/generalImages/ObjectEntry.jpg" height="300"><br/>

    <b>OE Send & OE Receive</b><br/>
    <p>If you want to send the created object to the Object Editor for saving, you would use the <i>OE Send</i> button. If you want to import an object from
    the Object Editor, you would use the <i>OE Retrieve</i> button. If you retrieve an object from the Object Editor, then the panel is immediately closed. Either you
    create an object or you retrieve an object.</p>
