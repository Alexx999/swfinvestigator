    <H3>Auto Updates</H3>
    <P>SWF Investigator is set to auto-update at launch by default. This behavior can be changed by the end-user in their preferences
    settings. End-users can also check for updates by selecting Help->Check For Updates. If you are doing your own builds of Flash
    Analyzer or you would prefer to centrally manage updates in house, then you can change the <I>updateConfig.xml</I> file
    located in the <I>configs</I> directory to point to different servers. The <i>url</i> tag is the URL for updates to
    .air installs. If you used a native installer (.exe or .dmg), then you would alter the <i>native_url</i> entry in the config file.
    In order for an update to work, the new version should be signed by the same key as the old version.
    </P>
