Adobe SWF Investigator Beta build notes

Requirements:
   Flash Builder 4.5 or later
   Adobe Flex SDK 4.6 or later
   AIR 3.1 or later

Setting up Flash Builder:
   1. Create a new Flash Builder workspace.
      Copy all of the project files into that workspace folder.
      All the projects will assume that they can cross-reference each other relative to that directory.
   
   2. Import all of the projects as Flash Builder projects.
      The as3crypto_source folder does not get imported but it does need to be in the same directory as the other project folders.

   3. You may see 3 warnings from the ParamHandlers project.
      To resolve the warnings, right click on the project and select Properties.
      Select Flex Library Build Path. Within that view, select the Library Path tab.
      Finally set framework linkage to its default (external).
      Once you resolve the warnings, the project will build the swc files for the bin directory.

   4. Build the overall application using the SWFInvestigator project.
      The project should build cleanly.
      You can export as either an AIR application or Native Application.
      Versions compiled as an AIR application cannot support native disassemblers.
